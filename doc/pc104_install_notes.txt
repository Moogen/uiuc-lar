                            Configuration on PC104
################################################################################

    Operating system:  
        Debian "Edge and a half" is a modified version of debian 4. 

    YARP: 
        Version 2.3.20 is the latest that is explicitly supported for the 
        hardware found on iCub running Edge-and-a-half. Later versions could 
        theoretically be installed would require much effort required to 
        install all dependencies.
        
    iCub Software: 
        Version 1.1.11 is the latest that will work with Yarp 2.3.20. 
        
    Drivers: 
        Updates are theoretically possible but at great risk of losing 
        functionality of current demos that involve motor function. 
        Drivers have not been updated for a long time and some updates
        change the PID controllers which may cause significant changes 
        to the motor behavior and ultimately risk physical damage.
        Since the other software is frozen at an older version, updating
        the drivers is not recommended.

                        Software installation on PC104
################################################################################

    The installation instructions are found here: 
        http://wiki.icub.org/wiki/ICub_server_laptop_installation_instructions

    Note that the link for setting up NFS shares is also important:
        http://wiki.icub.org/wiki/Generic_iCub_machine_installation_instructions#mount_remote_NFS_shares

    One key thing to be aware of is the ownership of the network files once they 
    are visible from the PC104. If the machine sharing them has a user called
    "icub" (which is the case for marvin) then you need to run the 
                $ sudo chown icub:icub -R /exports/code
    commands locally on the PC104. You should not need to use sudo to run 
    ccmake on the build directories. If you do, there is an ownership issue.

    Environment setup: 
        The current .bash_icub file should be correctly configured for compilation
        on the PC104. If the file is lost for some reason, it follows the 
        the configuration detailed on the "old laptop installation" page.

        http://wiki.icub.org/wiki/ICub_laptop_installation_instructions_for_old_releases

        A copy of the current bash_icub file should be kept in this folder
        for reference if it is lost from the iCub.


    Compilation on the PC104:
        The instructions found on this page were followed exactly with no hickups.

        http://wiki.icub.org/wiki/Compilation_on_the_pc104_old
    
    YARP Configuration:
        Once everything has been installed, you should be able to run YARP from
        another machine on the network and start the iCub. If iCub does not see 
        the yarp network then you'll need to make sure yarp is correctly 
        configured on the PC104 to look at the correct IP.

        Currently, marvin's IP is 10.0.0.4 so the following command will tell 
        the iCub to look to marvin for the yarp server. The 1000 parameter is 
        the port to look at (and 1000 is the default port for yarp). 

        $ yarp config 10.0.0.4 1000

        It is also important to make sure that the machine running the yarp
        server is also using the same version of yarp as the iCub. Some commands
        may work but other's may break. It's best to keep the configuration 
        consistent.


    Calibration:
        Once the yarp server is running happily, it should be possible to run 
        the calibration sequence on the iCub (normal startup procedure). You 
        may need to double check the directory in which the start-up script
        looks for the calibration files. The configuration as of writing this 
        document is not the standard defined on the instructions linked above.
